//! Recording a Rust panic so that something survives it.
//!
//! Before this existed a panic in the backend produced the default message on stderr and nothing
//! else: no log line, because the log plugin never sees a panic, and no file, so the next launch
//! had no idea the previous one had died. A player whose game vanished could only report that it
//! vanished, and the logs they attached ended at the last thing that went *right*.
//!
//! Two pieces. The hook writes `last-crash.json` next to the logs and mirrors the panic into the
//! log file; the next launch reports and clears it. Keeping the crash in its own file rather than
//! relying on the log alone means the next launch can *find* it without parsing 5 MB of text.
